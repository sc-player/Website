In order to fund your empire, you must build income buildings.  Income buildings are a long term investment.  After being completed, the building will generate a set amount of gold every 5 seconds.  Though income buildings can be upgraded, it is more efficient to build more income buildings.  Income buildings take up a large amount of space, so the amount of space you can keep safe from the horde is a major limiting factor to your income.
